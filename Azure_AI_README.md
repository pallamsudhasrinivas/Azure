# Azure AI 
In this document will discuss about AI services in available Azure.

Definition of AI: The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision- making, and translation between languages

Types of AI:

    Strong AI or General AI: A machine which learns like child based on experience, expert at everything. 
    Narrow AI: Focuses on specific tasks 

There are 3 approaches to build AI models in Azure

        1. Pre-Trained Models: Azure Cognitive Services
        2. Build Simple models: Limited or No code models builing 
        3. Build Complex models: For professional data scientists and teams for building complex AI Machine learning models
        
#Cognitive Services:

The goal of cognitive services is to get AI within reach of every developer, it work with these services doesn't need AI expertise. 
These services are exposed as API and developers can consume it for there apps development use cases.

There are number of services for Decision making, Text, Speech, Image, Language processing 

        1.  Desicion Making: 
            a.  Anomaly Detector: Identify potential problems early on
            b.  Content Moderator: Detect potentially ofensive or unwanted content
            c.  Personaliser: Create rich, personalised experiences for every user
            
        2.  Speech:
            a.  Speech-to-Text: Transcribe audio speech to readable, searchable format.
            b.  Text-to-Speech: Convert text to lifelike speech for more natural interfaces.
            c.  Speech Translation: Integrate real-time speech translation into your apps
            d.  Speaker Recognition: Identify and verify the people speaking based on audio.
            
        3.  Language:
            a.  Entity recognition: Identify commonly-used and domain-specific terms.
            b.  Sentiment analysis: Automatically detect sentiments and opinions from text.
            c.  Question Answering: Distill information into easy-to-navigate questions and answers.
            d.  Conversational language understanding: Enable your apps to interact with users through natural language.
            e.  Translator: Detect and translate more than 100 supported languages and dialects.
            
        4.  Vision:
            a.  Computer Vision: Analyze content in images and video.
            b.  Custom Vision: Customise image recognition to fit your business needs.
            c.  Face API: Detect and identify people and emotions in images.
            
        5.  Open AI:
            a.  OpenAI Service: Apply advanced language models to a variety of use cases.
